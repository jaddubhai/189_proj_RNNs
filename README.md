# COMPSCI 189 Project T - Introduction to RNNs (Team Chairun) 
This repository contains materials for COMPSCI 189 Project T, Week 10. We aim to provide students with a thorough introduction to RNNs, and specifically, GRUs and how they are being applied to modern portfolio theory

# Learning Goals: 
- Gain an understanding of how the RNN improves upon feed forward networks, the vanishing gradient problem and how the GRU solves this issue. 
- A brief overview of data manipulation and processing for NLP tasks
- Learn how to use the Keras functional API to build Bidirectional GRU networks 
- An overall appreciation of how NLP and ML can be used in fields like portfolio optimization

# Navigating the Repo: 
Our repo contains three main sections: teaching, assignments, and quiz.

- Teaching: contains both a note and slideshow which can be used as teaching materials for this project.
- Assignments: contains the project and solution notebook.
- Quiz: contains a brief quiz which can be used to test a student's understanding of the topics covered.
