# COMPSCI 189 Project T - Introduction to RNNs (Team Chairun) 
This repository contains materials for COMPSCI 189 Project T, Week 10. We aim to provide students with a thorough introduction to RNNs, and specifically, GRUs and how they are being applied to modern portfolio theory

# Learning Goals: 
1) Goal: Gain an understanding of how the RNN improves upon feed forward networks, the vanishing gradient problem and how the GRU solves this issue. 
   Method: The note and slideshow offer an introduction to RNN and what flaws int conventional NNs they were designed to fix. The notebook reinforces this by introducing a toy    example desgined specifically to highlight potential use-cases for RNNs (and LSTMs). The quiz questions and teaching materials also discuss the vanishing gradient problem,      and how LSTMs and GRUs were designed to fix this problem. While the notebook doesn't specifically address the vanishing gradient issue with an example, it definitely offers    a lot of room to play around with these more advanced neural networks. 
   
2) Goal: A brief overview of data manipulation and processing for NLP tasks
   Method: The focus of this project is understanding and implementing RNNs, however, we also give students a chance to manipulate data for an NLP task, from data sources that 
   are typically used in the finance industry (like yahoo finance). We also have an embeddings.ipynb notebook that uses the industry standard package gensim to build a Word2Vec    model for news data - this acts as a great segue to other topics in NLP. 

3) Goal: Learn how to use the Keras functional API to build Bidirectional GRU networks 
   Method: All of our models are built using tensorflow and keras, using several features of the API such as Sequential Models, Bidirectional Wrappers, etc. We hope that by the    end of the assignment, students are comfortable coding up neural networks in keras and understand exactly the sort of matrix manipulations required to use the API.
   
4) Goal: An overall appreciation of how NLP and ML can be used in fields like portfolio optimization
   Method: The main part of the project, as mentioned earlier, is built to try and tackle one of finance's most longstanding problems - stock price prediction/classification.      While we don't expect the students to get exceptionally high accuracy scores, we hope that the creativity of the approach, i.e. combining word embeddings and stock price        movement to generate vector representations of stocks, inspires students to think of novel ways to use NLP and neural networks in seemingly unrelated fields.

# Navigating the Repo: 
Our repo contains three main sections: teaching, assignments, and quiz.

- Teaching: contains both a note and slideshow which can be used as teaching materials for this project.
- Assignments: contains the project and solution notebook, and all the data required to run the code. Also contains a document that elaborates on the learning outcomes. 
- Quiz: contains a brief quiz which can be used to test a student's understanding of the topics covered.
