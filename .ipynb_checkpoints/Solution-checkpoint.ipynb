    "To get you started, we look at a simple example built specifically for RNNs - digit sequence classification. We define the problem as follows: assume you are an airline company running baggage checks at the airport. The maximum total baggaged weight allowed for the flight is 1570 pounds. We classify a baggage weight with label 0 if the cumulative sum so far is lesser than the threshold, and 1 if it goes above the threshold. Also assume that the length of all sequences is 35.

Define $p_i^{(t)}$ to be the price of stock $l_i$ on day $t$. Then, we can formally define our objective as follows:\n",

Then, we want to learn a mapping $\\hat y_i^{(t)} = f(N^{(t - \\mu)} \\cup \\ldots \\cup N^{(t)})$ such that $\\hat y_i^{(t)}$ accurately predicts $y_i^{(t)}$. More specifically, as is often the case with classification problems, we want to minimize the loss function given by the mean time-series cross-entropy loss:\n",

    "Before building our main classifier, recall that we need to do some preprocessing to get from our input above to the market vectors that are being used in the classifier. The documentation for tensorflow and Keras will help a lot with some of the manipulations required for this section. In particular, the documentation for `Dense` layers, `GRU` layers, `Activation` layers, `Bidirectional` layers, and `keras.activations.softmax` (which we have imported for you) may be helpful. The outline of the necessary preprocessing steps is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We want our input layer to be a tensor with shape $(k, 5, 64 \\kappa)$ <br>\n",
    "See how you can modify `X_in` $= \\begin{bmatrix} \n",
    "K_1^{(t_1 - 4)} & \\cdots & K_\\kappa^{(t_1 - 4)} & \\cdots \\cdots & K_1^{(t_1)} & \\cdots & K_\\kappa^{(t_1)} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & & \\vdots & & \\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "K_1^{(t_k - 4)} & \\cdots & K_\\kappa^{(t_k - 4)} & \\cdots \\cdots & K_1^{(t_k)} & \\cdots & K_\\kappa^{(t_k)}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{64k \\times 5\\kappa}$ from above to achieve this.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. By treating the stock embedding $s$ as a weight from the input layer to the first hidden layer, generate layer 1 of $score$ values of shape $(k, 5, \\kappa)$. We can do this because $score_i^{(t)}$ is defined as $K_i^{(t)} \\cdot s$, which aligns with the way weights act in neural networks. <br>\n",
    "*Hint:* Remember that we use `Dense` layers in Keras to represent a regular feedforward layer. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Apply softmax activations appropriately to generate layer 2 with the $\\alpha$ values, also of shape $(k, 5, \\kappa)$. <br>\n",
    "*Hint:* Remember, we define $\\alpha_i^{(t)} = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\exp(score_i^{(t)})}{\\sum_{j \\in [\\kappa], j \\neq i}exp(score_j^{(t)})}$. You can also combine this step with the previous one if you wish.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now, implement the Bi-GRU classifier model with $1024$ recurrent units. We will experiment with the number of units later when we conduct our hyperparameter tuning. Remember that for each sequence of 5 vectors that we input to the GRU, we are only interested in the prediction for the last one. That is, given $[\\alpha_1^{(t - 4)}, \\ldots, \\alpha_\\kappa^{(t - 4)}], \\ldots, [\\alpha_1^{(t)}, \\ldots, \\alpha_\\kappa^{(t)}]$, we only care about what the GRU predicts for day $t$ since that is the movement that we are trying to classify.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, apply a dense layer with a sigmoid activation to get a single value $\\hat y^{(t)}$ from the GRU output.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Train your model for $10$ epochs against the cross-entropy loss and report the train and validation loss after each epoch."

    "As you can see, our model is not doing particularly well on the test set so this method is probably not going to be very useful for price movement classification as it currently stands. Of course, there could be several reasons for the subpar performance, including but not limited to: insufficient training data, poor choice of model, poor quality of word embeddings, and bad choice of sequence length (5 days). Or perhaps, stock price classification/prediction isn't a viable goal, regardless of which neural network architecture we choose (also known asthe Random Walk Hypothesis for stock markets). Despite this unfortunate outcome, we hope that you learned something about RNNs and how they can be applied to a field like finance. Feel free to play around with these parameters to see if you can get a model worthy of use in the quantitative finance industry! "
