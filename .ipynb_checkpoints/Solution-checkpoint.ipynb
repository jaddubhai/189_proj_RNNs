    "For the purposes of this assignment, we will focus on training a classifier for 15 stocks from the S&P 500. The goal of our classifier is as follows:\n",
    "We are interested in training a bidirectional RNN model that learns a relationship between news taglines related to the 15 stocks $\\{l_1, \\ldots, l_{15}\\}$ that we have selected and the prices of those stocks. Define $p_i^{(t)}$ to be the price of stock $l_i$ on day $t$. Then, we can formally define our objective as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y_i^{(t)} = \\begin{cases} 1 & p_i^{(t)} \\geq p_i^{(t - 1)} \\\\ 0 & p_i^{(t)} < p_i^{(t - 1)} \\end{cases}$. Suppose our dataset $D = \\{N^{(t)}\\}_{t_{in} \\leq t \\leq t_f}$, where $N^{(t)}$ is a collection of all the articles from day $t$ and $t_{in}$ and $t_f$ represent the dates of the earliest and latest articles in our dataset resepctively. Then, we want to learn a mapping $\\hat y_i^{(t)} = f(N^{(t - \\mu)} \\cup \\ldots \\cup N^{(t)})$ such that $\\hat y_i^{(t)}$ accurately predicts $y_i^{(t)}$. More specifically, as is often the case with classification problems, we want to minimize the loss function given by the mean cross-entropy loss for all $15$ stocks:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{15} \\sum_{i = 1}^{15} \\mathcal{L}_i = \\frac{1}{15} \\sum_{i = 1}^{15} \\left( \\frac{-1}{t_f - t_{in}} \\sum_{t = t_{in}}^{t_f} \\big(y_i^{(t)} \\log \\hat y_i^{(t)} + (1 - y_i^{(t)}) \\log (1 - \\hat y_i^{(t)}) \\right)$$\n",
    "Here, we choose to use $\\mu = 4$, so we aim to classify the price movement of stock $l_i$ on day $t$, given by $p_i^{(t)}$, using news information from days $[t-4, t]$, i.e., articles $\\{N^{(t - 4)}, N^{(t - 3)}, N^{(t - 2)}, N^{(t - 1)}, N^{(t)}\\}$. Notice that we are including information from day $t$, so we are not *predicting* the price movement but rather identifying a relationship between the stock price movement and the information contained in the news taglines from day $t$ and the previous 4 days."

    "The code below loads word embeddings that we have pre-generated for 15 stocks from the S&P 500. We used news tagline data from Reuters (data sourced from https://github.com/vedic-partap/Event-Driven-Stock-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning/blob/master/input/news_reuters.csv) to create word embeddings for all of the articles in our dataset using a pretrained Spacy encoder and a Word2Vec model that we trained on our data (don't worry if you don't know what this means yet). Our dataset contains news articles from 2011 to 2017 so we should have enough data to build a fairly accurate classifier. You will explore algorithms for generating word embeddings in more detail later in the course but for this assignment, we have done the work for you so that you can focus on building RNN models for your stock movement classifier.\n",

Let $s_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{64}$ represent the stock embedding that we are trying to learn for stock $l_i$. We then define the following quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n_i^{(t)}$ be a news article from day $t$, for some $1 \\leq i \\leq |N^{(t)}|$. We associate 2 embedding vectors $K_i^{(t)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{64}$ and $V_i^{(t)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{300}$ with the article $n_i^{(t)}$, which we have computed for you below. We define $score(n_i^{(t)}, s_j) = K_i^{(t)} \\cdot s_j$ and the softmax variable $$\\alpha_i^{(t)} = \\frac{\\exp(score(n_i^{(t)}, s_j))}{\\sum_{n_k^{(t)} \\in N^{(t)}}exp(score(n_k^{(t)}, s_j))}$$\n",

    "Now that we have processed our data to include only robust inputs, let's do a quick refresher of what your initial input to the neural network is supposed to look like, and what dimensions it will have. Our key vectors for day $t$ are  $K_i^{(t)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{64}$, and we have at most $\\kappa$ articles per day. Thus, for any given day $t$, we can treat the input as $\\begin{bmatrix} K_1^{(t)} & \\cdots & K_\\kappa^{(t)} \\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{64 \\times \\kappa}$. Since our network uses five market vectors ($m^{(t - 4)}, \\ldots, m^{(t)}$) for predicting stock price movement on any given day, we must pass in a sequence of $\\kappa \\cdot 5$ key vectors. \n",
