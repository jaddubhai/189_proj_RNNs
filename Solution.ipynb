    "For the purposes of this assignment, we will focus on training a classifier for 15 stocks from the S&P 500. The goal of our classifier is as follows:\n",
    "We are interested in training a bidirectional RNN model that learns a relationship between news taglines related to the 15 stocks $\\{l_1, \\ldots, l_{15}\\}$ that we have selected and the prices of those stocks. Define $p_i^{(t)}$ to be the price of stock $l_i$ on day $t$. Then, we can formally define our objective as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y_i^{(t)} = \\begin{cases} 1 & p_i^{(t)} \\geq p_i^{(t - 1)} \\\\ 0 & p_i^{(t)} < p_i^{(t - 1)} \\end{cases}$. Suppose our dataset $D = \\{N^{(t)}\\}_{t_{in} \\leq t \\leq t_f}$, where $N^{(t)}$ is a collection of all the articles from day $t$ and $t_{in}$ and $t_f$ represent the dates of the earliest and latest articles in our dataset resepctively. Then, we want to learn a mapping $\\hat y_i^{(t)} = f(N^{(t - \\mu)} \\cup \\ldots \\cup N^{(t)})$ such that $\\hat y_i^{(t)}$ accurately predicts $y_i^{(t)}$. More specifically, as is often the case with classification problems, we want to minimize the loss function given by the mean cross-entropy loss for all $15$ stocks:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{15} \\sum_{i = 1}^{15} \\mathcal{L}_i = \\frac{1}{15} \\sum_{i = 1}^{15} \\left( \\frac{-1}{t_f - t_{in}} \\sum_{t = t_{in}}^{t_f} \\big(y_i^{(t)} \\log \\hat y_i^{(t)} + (1 - y_i^{(t)}) \\log (1 - \\hat y_i^{(t)}) \\right)$$\n",
    "Here, we choose to use $\\mu = 4$, so we aim to classify the price movement of stock $l_i$ on day $t$, given by $p_i^{(t)}$, using news information from days $[t-4, t]$, i.e., articles $\\{N^{(t - 4)}, N^{(t - 3)}, N^{(t - 2)}, N^{(t - 1)}, N^{(t)}\\}$. Notice that we are including information from day $t$, so we are not *predicting* the price movement but rather identifying a relationship between the stock price movement and the information contained in the news taglines from day $t$ and the previous 4 days."

    "The code below loads word embeddings that we have pre-generated for 15 stocks from the S&P 500. We used news tagline data from Reuters (data sourced from https://github.com/vedic-partap/Event-Driven-Stock-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning/blob/master/input/news_reuters.csv) to create word embeddings for all of the articles in our dataset using a pretrained Spacy encoder and a Word2Vec model that we trained on our data (don't worry if you don't know what this means yet). Our dataset contains news articles from 2011 to 2017 so we should have enough data to build a fairly accurate classifier. You will explore algorithms for generating word embeddings in more detail later in the course but for this assignment, we have done the work for you so that you can focus on building RNN models for your stock movement classifier.\n",

    "Before building our main classifier, recall that we need to do some preprocessing to get from our input above to the market vectors that are being used in the classifier. The documentation for tensorflow and Keras will help a lot with some of the manipulations required for this section. In particular, the documentation for `Lambda` layers, `Dense` layers, `Concatenate` layers, `keras.activations.softmax` (which we have imported for you), and `tf.split` may be helpful. The outline of the necessary preprocessing steps is as follows:\n",

    "*Hint:* Remember, we define $score_i^{(t)} = K_i^{(t)} \\cdot s$. Moreover, look at the documentation for applying Dense layers to rank $> 2$ tensors in Keras and see if you need to modify the input in some way before the input layer.\n",
    "<br>\n",
